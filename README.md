# Vacation-Planner
The Vacation Planner project is a streamlined solution to organize and manage all aspects of planning a trip, ensuring a stress-free and well-prepared journey. Using Trello, the planner allows you to break down the trip into manageable tasks and visually track your progress. Whether you're planning a solo getaway, a family vacation, or a group adventure, this project helps you centralize your ideas, tasks, and information in one convenient place.
